### Common Setup Steps

1. **Email Configuration**
   - Go to n8n Settings ‚Üí Credentials
   - Add your email provider credentials
   - Test the connection

2. **API Keys**
   - OpenWeatherMap: Sign up at openweathermap.org
   - GitHub: Create personal access token
   - Slack: Create app and get webhook URL

3. **Database Connections**
   - Add PostgreSQL credentials
   - Test connections before activating workflows

4. **File Monitoring**
   - Set up appropriate directories
   - Ensure n8n has read/write permissions

### Workflow Import Process

2. Click "Import from file"
3. Select the JSON workflow file
4. Review and adjust configurations
5. Save and activate the workflow

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Workflow Health Checks
- Monitor execution logs in n8n
- Set up error notifications
- Review performance metrics

### Regular Maintenance
- Update API keys when needed
- Review and adjust thresholds
- Clean up old data files
- Monitor database performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Triggers
- Schedule triggers for time-based automation
- Webhook triggers for real-time events
- File triggers for file-based automation

### Extending Workflows
- Add new conditions with IF nodes
- Include additional API calls
- Create custom data transformations
- Add new notification channels

### Error Handling
- Add error handling nodes
- Set up retry mechanisms
- Configure fallback actions

## üîí Security Considerations

- Store sensitive credentials securely
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Regularly rotate access tokens
- Monitor workflow access logs
- Implement proper error handling

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Testing**: Always test workflows in development first
2. **Documentation**: Keep workflow documentation updated
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for workflow failures
4. **Backup**: Regularly backup workflow configurations
5. **Version Control**: Use version control for workflow changes

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**
   - Check trigger configuration
   - Verify credentials are valid
   - Review execution logs

2. **API rate limits**
   - Implement delays between calls
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Monitor API usage

3. **Email delivery issues**
