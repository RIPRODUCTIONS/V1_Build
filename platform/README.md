# Platform Spine

This folder holds additive scaffolding for a durable orchestration spine. It does not affect the running backend.

Directories:

- `orchestration/` — Temporal workflows + LangGraph agent graphs (stubs)
- `data/` — Dagster/Prefect jobs (stubs)
- `shared/` — domain event schemas + tiny SDKs (Python/TS) + schema export

See `docs/ORCHESTRATION_SPINE.md` for the plan.
