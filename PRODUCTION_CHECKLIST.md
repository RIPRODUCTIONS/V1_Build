## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Code Review**
   - [ ] All code changes have been peer reviewed
   - [ ] Security review has been completed
   - [ ] Performance impact has been assessed

2. **Testing**
   - [ ] All unit tests pass
   - [ ] Integration tests pass
   - [ ] Security tests pass
   - [ ] Performance tests meet requirements
   - [ ] Staging deployment successful

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Deployment notes are prepared
   - [ ] Rollback plan is documented
   - [ ] Configuration changes are documented

### Deployment Steps
1. **Preparation**
   ```bash
   # 1. Backup current environment
   ./backup.sh
   
   # 2. Update environment configuration
   cp .env.production .env
   
   # 3. Pull latest code
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # 4. Run database migrations if needed
   # docker-compose exec n8n n8n migration:run
   ```

3. **Service Deployment**
   ```bash
   # 5. Deploy with production profile
   docker-compose --profile production up -d
   
   # 6. Wait for services to be healthy
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Health Checks**
   ```bash
   # 7. Verify application is responding
   curl -f https://your-domain.com/healthz
   
   # 8. Test critical workflows
   # Manual testing of key automation workflows
   ```

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Application health checks pass
- [ ] Critical workflows are tested
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are working
- [ ] Performance metrics are within expected ranges
- [ ] Backup verification completed

## Scaling Configuration

### Horizontal Scaling
- [ ] Load balancer configuration is updated
- [ ] Session storage is externalized (Redis)
- [ ] Database connection limits are increased
- [ ] Shared storage for workflows is configured

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Workflow polling intervals are optimized
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Caching is implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Resource allocation is optimized based on usage

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. **Quick Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Stop current deployment
   docker-compose down
   
   # Restore from backup
   tar -xzf /backups/n8n_backup_[timestamp].tar.gz -C /
   
   # Start previous version
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Full Rollback (5-15 minutes)
1. **Code Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous git commit
   git revert HEAD
   
   # Redeploy previous version
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Restore database from backup if needed
   # This should be tested in staging first
   ```

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Monitor application health and performance
- [ ] Review error logs and alerts
- [ ] Check backup completion status

### Weekly
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed
- [ ] Performance analysis and optimization

### Monthly
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Capacity planning review
- [ ] Update documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Service Outage
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Check infrastructure status
   - Review error logs
   - Verify external service dependencies
   - Implement temporary workarounds if needed

2. **Communication**
   - Update status page
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document incident timeline

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fix or rollback
   - Verify service restoration
   - Conduct post-incident review

### Security Incident
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Implement containment measures

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
