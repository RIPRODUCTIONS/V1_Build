# Stafford Slack Site

Static site for a stable /slack redirect and signage.

## Quick deploy (Netlify)
1. Drag-and-drop this folder into Netlify or run .
2. Confirm  works:  302 -> Slack invite.
3. Map a custom domain (e.g., stafford.example.com). Optional path: .

## GitHub Pages
- Use  only (GitHub Pages ignores Netlify ).
- For a stable short link, prefer Netlify, Nginx, or a URL shortener.

## After domain is final
- Tell me the final URL (e.g., https://stafford.example.com/slack) and I will regenerate QR assets targeting it.
