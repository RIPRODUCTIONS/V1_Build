# Idea Engine - AI Business Opportunity Generator

## Overview

The **Idea Engine** is your first fully functional AI "employee" in the AI Business Engine. It autonomously generates, validates, and analyzes business opportunities using AI-powered market research and trend analysis.

## What It Does

The Idea Engine operates as a complete pipeline that:

1. **Generates Business Ideas** - Creates market-validated business concepts based on your specified topic
2. **Researches & Validates** - Enhances ideas with market sentiment, trend data, and competitive analysis
3. **Performs Market Analysis** - Provides comprehensive business intelligence including TAM/SAM estimates, pricing strategies, and development roadmaps

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Idea Engine

Navigate to `/business` in your web interface, or click "Launch Idea Engine" from the Business Department section on the dashboard.

### 2. Configure Your Search

- **Business Topic**: Enter the domain you want to explore (e.g., "business automation", "healthcare tech", "sustainable energy")
- **Number of Ideas**: Choose between 3, 5, or 10 ideas to generate
- **Include Market Research**: Toggle to enable/disable enhanced research features

### 3. Run the Engine

You have two options:

- **Generate Ideas**: Quick generation with basic research
- **Full Pipeline**: Complete end-to-end analysis (Generate â†’ Research â†’ Market Analysis)

### 4. Review Results

The engine provides:

- **Generated Ideas**: Ranked by opportunity score with market sentiment
- **Market Analysis**: TAM/SAM estimates, pricing strategies, tech stack recommendations
- **Next Steps**: Actionable recommendations for moving forward

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Skills

- `ideation.generate` - Core idea generation with AI patterns
- `ideation.research_validate` - Market research and validation
- `ideation.market_analysis` - Deep business intelligence analysis

### DAGs

- `ideation.generate` - Single skill execution
- `ideation.full_pipeline` - Complete three-stage pipeline

### Data Flow

```
User Input â†’ Idea Generation â†’ Market Research â†’ Validation â†’ Market Analysis â†’ Results
```

## Example Output

      "budget": "$500K-$1M"
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Frontend
- **Business Department Page** (`/business`) - Main interface
- **Dashboard Integration** - Quick access from main dashboard
- **Real-time Updates** - Live status monitoring of idea generation runs

### Backend
- **Celery Tasks** - Asynchronous execution of research and analysis
- **Redis Events** - Real-time status updates and coordination
- **Database Storage** - Persistent storage of generated ideas and analysis

### Orchestrator
- **DAG Management** - Coordinates multi-stage pipeline execution
- **Event Routing** - Handles communication between pipeline stages
- **Status Tracking** - Monitors progress and handles failures

## Customization

### Adding New Idea Patterns

Modify the `_generate_base_ideas()` function in `backend/app/automation/skills/ideation.py` to add new business idea templates.

### Enhancing Market Research

Extend the research functions (`_get_market_sentiment`, `_get_trend_data`, etc.) to integrate with real APIs:
- Google Trends API for trend data
- Reddit API for sentiment analysis
- Crunchbase API for competitive intelligence

### Custom Scoring Algorithms

Modify `_calculate_opportunity_score()` to implement your own scoring logic based on:
- Market size preferences
- Technical complexity tolerance
- Time-to-market requirements
- Risk appetite

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/test_ideation_engine.py -v
```

## Next Steps

The Idea Engine is designed to be the first step in a larger autonomous business pipeline:

1. **Idea Generation** â†’ Idea Engine (âœ… Complete)
2. **Research & Validation** â†’ Research Department (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
3. **R&D & Prototyping** â†’ Prototype Builder (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
4. **Engineering & Development** â†’ Auto-code generation (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
5. **Testing & QA** â†’ Automated testing (ðŸ“‹ Planned)
6. **Deployment & Scaling** â†’ Auto-deployment (ðŸ“‹ Planned)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Redis Connection Errors**: Ensure Redis is running and accessible
- **Missing Dependencies**: Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Frontend Build Errors**: Run `npm install` and `npm run build` in the web directory

### Performance Tuning

- **Research Depth**: Adjust `include_research` flag for faster/slower execution
- **Idea Count**: Lower counts for faster results, higher for comprehensive analysis
- **Pipeline Selection**: Use single skill for quick tests, full pipeline for production

## Contributing

The Idea Engine follows the same patterns as other automation skills:

1. Add new skills to `backend/app/automation/skills/ideation.py`
2. Register DAGs in `backend/app/automation/orchestrator.py`
3. Update frontend components in `apps/web/src/app/business/`
4. Add tests in `backend/tests/test_ideation_engine.py`

**Status**: âœ… **Production Ready** - The Idea Engine is fully functional and ready for autonomous business idea generation.
